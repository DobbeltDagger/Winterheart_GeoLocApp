        <h3>What is the <em>Heart of Winter?</em></h3>
        <p>Winterheart is a long series of invisible lines that spread across the globe. It is about two spiral lines, which combined form heart shapes within each other. See the design above on Google earth. The idea is that these lines are made visible by people who want to participate in this project.</p>

        <h3>Creative potential</h3>
        <p>The Heart of Winter has incredible creative potential in terms of ways to make the lines visible. You can plant trees, lay stones, line up and much more - and then take a picture and put it on the site with comments. WINTERHEART is characterized by linking countries, places and people together via activities on the Heart Lines - across borders, religion, political beliefs, age, gender, etc.</p>

        // <p>Tilst housing association has chosen to plant a number of fine yew trees on a heart line that crosses the association's area.</p>
        // <p>The first measures have taken place. See examples in several places on this page.</p>

        // <p>The contributions to making the heart lines visible can have very different characters, appealing to creativity and ingenuity. Some here permanent characters like the row of yew plants earlier on this page. Above, a German student has marked a heart line on the coast in Moesgaard forest.</p>
        // <p>Over here, museum inspector Marianne Sørensen from the Vejle Art Museum used nature's mushrooms to temporarily mark a heart line in a small forest close to the Tørskind gravel pit.</p>
        // <p>Here the heart lines 13 and 14 meet just south of Randers. The land there is owned by Randers Municipality and there was an opportunity - in connection with a teaching course with school children - to place a marking stone with this meeting/cross engraved. See below.</p>

        <h2>The history behind the <em>Heart of Winter</em></h2>
        <p>Vinterens Hjerte started in practice in 2003 by planting yew trees on the heart lines in Aarhus. At that time Jørn Rønnau received funds from Aarhus Municipality's "Green Fund" for the purchase of approx. 1,000 yew trees. They were given to the Aarhusians who lived on the heart lines and who wanted to actively participate in the creation of the <em>"Heart of Winter"</em> by planting the trees on the line in their gardens, institutions or companies, and then posting pictures of their contribution on Winterheart's website.</p>
        <p>The website is structured so that the participants themselves can post their own photos and stories about their participation on the website as inspiration for other future participants.</p>
        // <p>WWW.WINTERHEART.DK</p>
        // <p>The municipality has made GIS maps of Aarhus Municipality available. These cards combined with the heart lines make the "Heart of Winter" accessible to everyone. The website is structured so that the participants themselves can post their own photos and stories about their participation on the website as inspiration for other future participants.</p>
